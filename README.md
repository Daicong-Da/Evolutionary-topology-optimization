# Evolutionary-topology-optimization
This document provides the 2D code of the Evolutionary Topology Optimization (ETO) method for continuum structures with smooth boundary representation. 
It combines advantages of the evolutionary strategy in structural optimization and the level-set function (LSF) constructed by nodal sensitivity numbers,
to tailor the topology based on each "point" of the design domain.
